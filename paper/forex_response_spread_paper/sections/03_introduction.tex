\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

The paper is organized as follows: in Sect. \ref{sec:data_time} we present our
data set of foreign exchange pairs and briefly describe the physical and trade time. We then
analyze the definition of the response functions in Sect.
\ref{sec:response_functions}, and compute them for the majors pairs.
In Sect. \ref{sec:spread_impact} we show how the spread impact the values of the
response functions. Our conclusions follows in Sect. \ref{sec:conclusion}.
