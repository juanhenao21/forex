\section{Response functions}\label{sec:response_functions_def}

In Sect. \ref{subsec:key_concepts} we establish the fundamental quantities used
in the price response definitions. In Sect. \ref{subsec:time_definition} we
describe the physical time scale and the trade time scale. We introduce the
price response functions used in literature in Sect. \ref{subsec:response_def}.

\subsection{Key concepts}\label{subsec:key_concepts}


Due to the lack of prices information in the data, we consider a basic definition
of the price given by \cite{patterns_forex,political_forex,forex_liquidity}

\begin{equation}
    S_{i} \left(t\right) = \frac{a_{i}\left(t\right) + b_{i}\left(t\right)}{2}
\end{equation}
