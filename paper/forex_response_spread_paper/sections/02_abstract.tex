      Due to the lack of foreign exchange data, an analysis considering large
      intervals of time was not possible. Due to the large interest in foreign
      exchange market now is possible to access tick data for different years.
      We analyzed price response functions in the foreign exchange market for
      different years and different time scales. The price response functions
      show an increase to a maximum followed by a slowly decrease in trade time
      scale and in physical time scale for all the analyzed years. Further, we
      use a pip spread definition to group different foreign exchange pairs to
      analyze the impact in the price response functions. We found that large
      pip spreads have stronger impact. The results of this paper were also
      seen in price responses fuctions in correlated financial markets.
