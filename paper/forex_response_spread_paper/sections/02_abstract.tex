\abstract{
Using data from the foreign exchange market, we analyzed
the response functions of the majors pairs for three different years.
We used two time definitions to compute the response functions: trade time scale and
physical time scale. We computed the self-response functions for the seven
pairs. Both
responses increase to a maximum and then slowly decrease. Hence, the trend in
the response functions is eventually reversed. To analyze the spread impact we
used XX foreing pairs. We tested the impact in trade time scale and physical
time scale. In both scales the less liquid pairs show a larger impact in the
response due to the large spread.
