\section{Spread impact in price response functions}\label{sec:spread_impact}

To analyze the spread impact in price response functions, we used 47 foreign
exchange pairs from three different years (Appendix \ref{app:fx_pairs_spread}).
As we showed in Sect. \ref{sec:introduction}, due to the difference in the
position of the decimal points between foreign exchange pairs, to compare them
we need to introduce a ``scaling factor'' with the purpose of bringing the pip
to the left of the decimal point. For example, the scaling factor for the
USD/JPY is $100$ and that for the EUR/USD is $10000$.

The pip bid-ask spread is defined as \cite{micro_eff}:

\begin{equation}
    s_{pip} = \left(a\left(t\right) - b\left(t\right)\right) \cdot
    \text{scaling factor}
\end{equation}

With the $s_{pip}$ we can group the foreign exchange pairs and check how the
average strength of the price response functions on trade time scale and
physical time scale behave. For each pair we compute the pip bid-ask spread in
every trade along the market time. Then we average the spread during the trade
weeks in the different years. With this value we group the foreign exchange
pairs.

             groups in three different years (2011, 2015 and 2019).}

We used three intervals to select the stocks groups ($s_{pip}<0.6$,
$0.6 \le s_{pip} <7$ and $7 \le s_{pip} <40$). The detailed information of the
foreign exchange pairs, spread and the groups can be seen in Appendix
\ref{app:fx_pairs_spread}. With the groups of the stocks defined, we averaged
the price response functions of each group.

In Fig. \ref{fig:spread_impact} we show the average response functions for
three groups in three different years. From year to year the groups can vary
depending on the pip spread. The average price response function for the pairs
with smaller pip spreads (more liquid) have in average the weakest signal in
the figure for all the years and both time scales. On the other hand, the
average price responses for the pairs with larger pip spread (less liquid) have
in average the strongest signal for all the years in both time scales.

From Sect. \ref{sec:response_functions} we could expect the
increase-maximum-decrease behavior. In all the figures with the average
response on trade time scale, we can see that the curves keep their shape and
follow an increase, reach a maximum and then start to slowly decrease. The
response in trade time scale seems to be noisier, with large changes in the
first time steps. This aggregate noise can be related with the crosses and
exotics pairs, who tend to fluctuate more.

For the years 2015 and 2019 in physical time scale, the
increase-maximum-decrease behavior is not that well defined as in Sect.
\ref{sec:response_functions} or as in the average response in trade time scale.
However, some groups tend to behave in the expected way. The groups that do not
follow the trend, seem to have a instantaneous high response that slowly
decrease with time. This behavior is mostly noticeable in the year 2019.

For the year 2011 in physical time scale, the increase-maximum-decrease shape
is not present. For the group 1 and 2 the response decrease almost immediately.
For the group 3, it starts to decrease, but then is starts to grow and
stabilize at the end of the time lag.

In the three plots, the foreign exchange market seems to have a global
influence over all the pairs in the corresponding years. A similar behavior
can be seen in correlated financial markets \cite{my_paper_response_financial}.
