\section{Spread impact in price response functions}\label{sec:spread_impact}


As we showed in Sect. \ref{sec:introduction}, due to the difference in the position of the decimal
points between foreign exchange rates, we need to introduce a ``scaling factor''
with the purpose of bringing the pip to the left of the decimal point.
For example, the scaling factor for the USD/JPY is $100$ and that for the
EUR/USD is $10000$.

The pip bid-ask spread is defined as \cite{micro_eff}:

\begin{equation}
    \text{pip}_{spread} = \left(a\left(t\right) - b\left(t\right)\right) \cdot \text{scaling factor}
\end{equation}
