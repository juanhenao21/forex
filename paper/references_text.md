Technical analysis is the study of historical price action in order to identify
patterns and determine probabilities of future movements in the market through
the use of technical studies, indicators, and other analysis tools.
Technical analysis boils down to two things: identifying trend or identifying
support/resistance through the use of price charts and/or timeframes.
Markets can only do three things: move up, down, or sideways. Prices typically
move in a zigzag fashion, and as a result, price action has only two states:
"Range" - when prices zigzag sideways, and "Trend" - prices either zigzag
higher (up trend, or bull trend), or prices zigzag lower (down trend, or bear
trend)

**Microstructure of Foreign Exchange Markets**
Microstructure models, by contrast, examine how information relevant to the
trading decisions of market participants becomes embedded in the prices of FX
instruments via the trading process. According to this perspective, trading is
not an ancillary market activity that can be ignored when considering how the
prices of FX instruments behave. Rather, trading is an integral part of the
process through which the prices of FX instruments are determined and evolve
through time.
(Microstructure models)

Over time trading in the FX market has involved several different types of
participants. The FX dealers working at major banks have always been the
central intermediaries. More specifically, they play the role of liquidity
suppliers who are willing to be the counter-parties to trades initiated by
others. End-users comprise the other principal type of participant. This group
comprises the financial and non-financial customers of dealer-banks, as well as
other (non-dealer) entities that trade on electronic systems. Trading by
financial end-users is generated by allocative, speculative and risk management
motives. Trading by non-financial end-users is generated by goods trade,
cross-border investment and risk management.
