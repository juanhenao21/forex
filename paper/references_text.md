Fundamental Analysis is a broad term that describes the act of trading based
purely on global aspects that influence supply and demand of currencies,
commodities, and equities. There are a variaty of sources to base the opinion
such as central banks, economic realeases, geopolitical tensions, weather,

Technical analysis is the study of historical price action in order to identify
patterns and determine probabilities of future movements in the market through
the use of technical studies, indicators, and other analysis tools.
Technical analysis boils down to two things: identifying trend or identifying
support/resistance through the use of price charts and/or timeframes.
Markets can only do three things: move up, down, or sideways. Prices typically
move in a zigzag fashion, and as a result, price action has only two states:
"Range" - when prices zigzag sideways, and "Trend" - prices either zigzag
higher (up trend, or bull trend), or prices zigzag lower (down trend, or bear
trend)

**Microstructure of Foreign Exchange Markets**
Microstructure models, by contrast, examine how information relevant to the
trading decisions of market participants becomes embedded in the prices of FX
instruments via the trading process. According to this perspective, trading is
not an ancillary market activity that can be ignored when considering how the
prices of FX instruments behave. Rather, trading is an integral part of the
process through which the prices of FX instruments are determined and evolve
through time.

Over time trading in the FX market has involved several different types of
participants. The FX dealers working at major banks have always been the
central intermediaries. More specifically, they play the role of liquidity
suppliers who are willing to be the counter-parties to trades initiated by
others. End-users comprise the other principal type of participant. This group
comprises the financial and non-financial customers of dealer-banks, as well as
other (non-dealer) entities that trade on electronic systems. Trading by
financial end-users is generated by allocative, speculative and risk management
motives. Trading by non-financial end-users is generated by goods trade,
cross-border investment and risk management.

Although the spot FX market is often cited as the world’s largest financial
market, one characterized by huge trading volumes and very high liquidity, this
characterization overlooks the substantial differences in trading volume and
liquidity across different currency pairs. Investors wanting to exchange some
currency pairs face significant trading costs, particularly for large trades.

**Intraday spot foreign exchange market**
The market efficiency characterizes how fast and precise those news are
reflected in the exchange rate on the market. Virtually, any financial asset
can be bought or sold within seconds during trading sessions. Foreign Exchange
market with its 24 hours trading, is considered to be the most liquid of all
financial markets. Liquidity influences the attractiveness of an investment and
the market efficiency. Finally, the volatility of financial markets is a
headache for corporate managers and the source of gain for speculators. It
differs greatly between sectors and geographical regions.
(Market efficiency, liquidity and volatility)

Market efficiency is defined by how fast and how accurately all the relevant
information is absorbed by the market, in particular in the price and the
traded volume.
(Market efficiency)

Semi-strong market efficiency form claims that all public information is
incorporated in prices, which exclude any privately known information. In other
words, if a market is proved to be efficient in semi-strong form, neither
fundamental nor technical analysis can consistently produce abnormal returns.
(Semi-strong market efficiency)

The weak form of market efficiency states that all past prices are reflected in
the today's price on the market. This basically means that is it not possible
to get any significant advantage on the market by analyzing pastprices only, as
it is done in the case of technical analysis. However, fundamental analysis can
be successfully applied.
(Weak market efficiency)

Tools used to test market efficiency are dependent on the form of efficiency to
be tested. Weak form may be detected using unit root tests. Semi-strong form is
analyzed using cointegration, Granger causality and variance decomposition
analysis.

Market liquidity characterizes how easy and fast the assets can be exchanged,
moved, bought or sold, without effecting price and incurring significant costs.

Volatility is traditionally measured using basic statistical tools, like
variance and standard deviation. According to Mandelbrot (Mandelbrot, Hudson,
2004, p. 48), this measure only reflects one part of the real market risk,
"benign risk". The remaining "wild risk" is often neglected by researches,
unless they use stable Pareto distributions. An alternative measure of
volatility could be the number of price ticks arriving per unit of time
– useful information for speculators.
