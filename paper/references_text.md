Technical analysis is the study of historical price action in order to identify
patterns and determine probabilities of future movements in the market through
the use of technical studies, indicators, and other analysis tools.
Technical analysis boils down to two things: identifying trend or identifying
support/resistance through the use of price charts and/or timeframes.
Markets can only do three things: move up, down, or sideways. Prices typically
move in a zigzag fashion, and as a result, price action has only two states:
"Range" - when prices zigzag sideways, and "Trend" - prices either zigzag
higher (up trend, or bull trend), or prices zigzag lower (down trend, or bear
trend)
