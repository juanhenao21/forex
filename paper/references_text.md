Bearish candles are typically red. It means the opening price was higher than
the closing price for the specified time interval. Bullish candles are
typically green. It means the opening price was lower than the closing price
for the specified time interval.

Fundamental Analysis is a broad term that describes the act of trading based
purely on global aspects that influence supply and demand of currencies,
commodities, and equities. There are a variaty of sources to base the opinion
such as central banks, economic realeases, geopolitical tensions, weather,
seasonality, among others.

Technical analysis is the study of historical price action in order to identify
patterns and determine probabilities of future movements in the market through
the use of technical studies, indicators, and other analysis tools.
Technical analysis boils down to two things: identifying trend or identifying
support/resistance through the use of price charts and/or timeframes.
Markets can only do three things: move up, down, or sideways. Prices typically
move in a zigzag fashion, and as a result, price action has only two states:
"Range" - when prices zigzag sideways, and "Trend" - prices either zigzag
higher (up trend, or bull trend), or prices zigzag lower (down trend, or bear
trend)

**Microstructure of Foreign Exchange Markets**
Microstructure models, by contrast, examine how information relevant to the
trading decisions of market participants becomes embedded in the prices of FX
instruments via the trading process. According to this perspective, trading is
not an ancillary market activity that can be ignored when considering how the
prices of FX instruments behave. Rather, trading is an integral part of the
process through which the prices of FX instruments are determined and evolve
through time.
(Microstructure models)

Over time trading in the FX market has involved several different types of
participants. The FX dealers working at major banks have always been the
central intermediaries. More specifically, they play the role of liquidity
suppliers who are willing to be the counter-parties to trades initiated by
others. End-users comprise the other principal type of participant. This group
comprises the financial and non-financial customers of dealer-banks, as well as
other (non-dealer) entities that trade on electronic systems. Trading by
financial end-users is generated by allocative, speculative and risk management
motives. Trading by non-financial end-users is generated by goods trade,
cross-border investment and risk management.
(Forex participants)

Although the spot FX market is often cited as the world’s largest financial
market, one characterized by huge trading volumes and very high liquidity, this
characterization overlooks the substantial differences in trading volume and
liquidity across different currency pairs. Investors wanting to exchange some
currency pairs face significant trading costs, particularly for large trades.
(non-liquid pairs)

**Intraday spot foreign exchange market**
The market efficiency characterizes how fast and precise those news are
reflected in the exchange rate on the market. Virtually, any financial asset
can be bought or sold within seconds during trading sessions. Foreign Exchange
market with its 24 hours trading, is considered to be the most liquid of all
financial markets. Liquidity influences the attractiveness of an investment and
the market efficiency. Finally, the volatility of financial markets is a
headache for corporate managers and the source of gain for speculators. It
differs greatly between sectors and geographical regions.
(Market efficiency, liquidity and volatility)

Market efficiency is defined by how fast and how accurately all the relevant
information is absorbed by the market, in particular in the price and the
traded volume.
(Market efficiency)

Semi-strong market efficiency form claims that all public information is
incorporated in prices, which exclude any privately known information. In other
words, if a market is proved to be efficient in semi-strong form, neither
fundamental nor technical analysis can consistently produce abnormal returns.
(Semi-strong market efficiency)

The weak form of market efficiency states that all past prices are reflected in
the today's price on the market. This basically means that is it not possible
to get any significant advantage on the market by analyzing pastprices only, as
it is done in the case of technical analysis. However, fundamental analysis can
be successfully applied.
(Weak market efficiency)

Tools used to test market efficiency are dependent on the form of efficiency to
be tested. Weak form may be detected using unit root tests. Semi-strong form is
analyzed using cointegration, Granger causality and variance decomposition
analysis.
(Tools to test market efficiency)

Market liquidity characterizes how easy and fast the assets can be exchanged,
moved, bought or sold, without effecting price and incurring significant costs.
(Market liquidity)

Volatility is traditionally measured using basic statistical tools, like
variance and standard deviation. According to Mandelbrot (Mandelbrot, Hudson,
2004, p. 48), this measure only reflects one part of the real market risk,
"benign risk". The remaining "wild risk" is often neglected by researches,
unless they use stable Pareto distributions. An alternative measure of
volatility could be the number of price ticks arriving per unit of time
– useful information for speculators.
(Volatility measurement)

**Intraday return inefficiency and long memory in the volatilities of forex**
Market efficiency refers to the speed, precision, and accuracy with which
markets absorb and reflect all available information, including that related to
trading volume of single and multiple assets.
(Market efficiency)

In specific, the weak form efficient market hypothesis postulates that it is
meaningless to forecast future asset values based on historical prices as all
that information is reflected in the current asset price. The semi-strong
efficient market hypothesis states that both, historical and all publicly
available information, are reflected by current security prices, making it
impossible to outperform the market portfolio (e.g., an index tracking
portfolio) using any piece of financial or economic information disclosed.
Fundamental analysis is consequently worthless. The strong efficient market
hypothesis states that aside from historical and publicly available
information, current security prices also reflect any type of information
market insiders have access to (i.e. private information), thus it is not
possible for market insiders to realize abnormal returns.
(Efficient market hypothesis)

despite the important role all three hypotheses play in economic and financial
market theory their rationale has been put into question when considering the
behavior of financial markets under the effect of phenomena such as market
speculation, herd behavior, and the psychological/emotional reaction of
financial markets to political and macroeconomic innovations. These phenomena
for instance have been observed to temporarily alter the market equilibrium for
security pricing, giving room to narrow time lapses (time periods during which
security markets correct themselves) of market inefficiency. It is in this
context where an analysis of efficiency becomes worth pursuing.
(Against Efficient market hypothesis)

We select major currencies from Europe and Japan for our model implementation
because they are some of the most traded worldwide and belong to some of the
largest economies that differ in underlying drivers of currency value (through
demand and supply of the currencies) such as economic structure (e.g.,
economies with larger financial and banking sectors tend to attract more
capital), volatility (e.g., economies with stronger currencies and exposed to
higher volatility: financial and political, tend to attract more currency
buyers and sellers) and, most importantly, trading profiles (import–export).
Hence, we would expect those currencies from economies with lower volatility,
stronger financial sectors, and higher trade surplus to be more efficient.
(Selection of the currencies)

**Economic and political effects on currency clustering dynamics**
Similar to other financial markets, exchange rates between different currencies
are determined by the laws of supply and demand in the forex market.
Additionally, market participants (financial institutions, traders, and
investors) consider macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and inflation
to assess the value of a currency. Central banks may participate in the forex
market as well, when pursuing their fiscal and monetary policy goals. The
degree of central bank interventions (CBIs) in the market determines the regime
in which a currency trades.
Some central banks peg their currency to another currency, using their assets
in the market to accomplish a fixed exchange rate. If a central bank does not
intervene, its currency is considered free-floating, meaning that the exchange
rate is mostly determined by market forces. Some central banks allow their
currency to float freely within a certain range, in a so-called managed float
regime.
(Central bank control)

The appreciation of one currency implies the depreciation of the currency
against which it is traded.
(Fx characteristic)

Qualitatively, we can distinguish between hard and soft currencies; hard
currencies are considered a store of value due to their stability even in
adverse global economic conditions, and soft currencies are more volatile, for
example due to deteriorating economic conditions in respective countries.
(Qualitatively description of currencies)

We can distinguish between reserve currencies, funding currencies, and
commodity currencies.
Reserve currencies are currencies which central banks typically hold as foreign
exchange reserves, for which they prefer hard currencies (USD, EUR, GBP).
Funding currencies are currencies which can be borrowed at low interest rates
(CHF, JPY).
Commodity currencies are currencies of countries whose economic output strongly
depends on the price of one or more commodities (NOK, AUD, CAD, NZD).

**The Returns to Currency Speculation in Emerging Markets**
Bid-ask spreads are two to four times larger in emerging markets than in
developed countries.
(Spread)

The bid-ask spreads for both the spot and forward market are much larger for
emerging markets than for developed economies. For developed countries, the
median bid-ask spread in the spot market was between 0.039 and 0.051 percent
depending on the sample period chosen, while the median spreads for one-week
and one-month forwards were in the range of 0.042-0.053 percent and 0.045-0.057
percent, respectively. We found the spreads to be between two and four times
larger for emerging market currencies than for developed country currencies.
(Spread values)

**Patterns in high-frequency FX data**
Throughout the paper we consider a simpler definition of the price given by
$$x_{i} = (bid_{i} + ask_{i} ) / 2$$
(Midpoint price definition)

In financial markets, the flow of time is discontinuous: over weekends trading
comes to a standstill or, inversely, at news announcements there are spurts of
market activity.
(Flow of time)

We use a tick-by-tick database composed of 13 currency pairs spanning five
years, from December 1, 2002 to December 1, 2007. The following currency pairs
are considered with the total number of ticks given in parenthesis: AUD-JPY
(15’286’858), AUD-USD (7’037’203), CHF-JPY (17’081’987), GBP-CHF (27’141’146),
GBP-JPY (26’423’199), GBP-USD (13’918’523), EUR-AUD (19’111’129), EUR-GBP
(13’847’688), EUR-CHF (9’912’921), EUR-JPY (22’594’396), EUR-USD (13’093’081),
USD-CHF (13’812’055), USD- JPY (13’507’173). The difference in the number of
ticks is due to varying liquidity and the fact that some exchange rates are
synthetically generated from two data streams, i.e., market makers quote prices
based on two feeds creating cross-rates. As an example, GBP-JPY is derived from
GBP-USD and USD-JPY. This, however, does not mean that the GBP-JPY data is
artificial as it is also real published market data. The approximately 26.5
million ticks in the GBP-JPY cross-rate are derived from the ticks in GBP-USD
(13.9 million) and USD-JPY (13.5 million).

**Information Flows in Foreign Exchange Markets**
The foreign exchange (FX) market is the largest financial market in the world,
with a daily trading volume of about five trillion U.S. dollars (USDs; Bank for
International Settlements (BIS, 2013)). Also, the FX market is largely
organized as an over-the-counter (OTC) market, meaning that there is no
centralized exchange and that market participants can have only partial
knowledge about the trades of other market participants and available liquidity
in different market segments. Hence, despite its size and sophistication, the
FX market is fairly opaque and decentralized because of its market structure
when compared to, for example, the major equity markets.
(Introduction to foreign exchange markets)

In centralized, exchange-based markets, there is a single price at any point in
time—the market price. In decentralized markets, by default, there is no
visible common price. The FX market is the largest market of this kind.
(Centralized and decentralized markets)

**Teaching the Bid-Ask Spread and Triangular Arbitrage**
The FX market is a decentralized or over-the-counter (OTC) market without
common trading floor. The FX market is open 24 hours a day. There are several
financial centers with different time zones in the world. When the trading of
one currency is closed at one financial center, it continues on the other
financial center with the different time zone. International banks serve as
dealers who make a market by standing ready to buy or sell foreign currencies
for their own accounts. The bid price represents the price a bank dealer is
willing to buy for a currency and the ask price is the price a bank dealer is
willing to sell for a currency. Therefore, bank clients buy at the ask price
from the dealer and sell at the bid price to the dealer. The bid-ask spread,
the difference between the ask price and the bid price, is the compensation
(transaction cost) to the dealer (bank clients). The bid-ask spread and bid-ask
relationship are basic parts of the FX market microstructure.
(Introduction to foreign exchange markets)

They find that bid-ask spreads increase when the FX volatility increases, and
they decrease when the dealer competition increases.
(Behavior of the spread)

Quote (tick-by-tick) data with bid and ask prices for GBP vs USD currency pair
are needed and they can be purchased from Tick Data, LLC. The trading of FX is
24 hours a day. The quote data from Tick Data are time stamped to the
millisecond (HH:MM:SS.mmm) and start at the first millisecond of 6 PM
(18:00:00.001) Eastern Time (ET) on Sunday and end at the last millisecond of
5:59 PM (17:59:59.999) ET on Friday for each week. So, Tick Data classifies
one-day 24- hour trading as 18:00:00.001 ET on the previous date to
17:59:59.999 ET on the current day. For example, the 24-hour trading time on
June 23, 2016 is from 18:00:00.001 ET on June 22, 2016 to 17:59:59.999 ET on
June 23, 2016.
(Data description)

The bid-ask spread can be computed as follows
$$s(t) = a(t) - b(t)$$
$$\% s(t) = \frac{a(t) - b(t)}{m(t)}$$
where $b(t)$ and $a(t)$ are bid price and ask price at time t and
$$m(t) = \frac{b(t) + a(t)}{2}$$
is the quoted midpoint at time t
